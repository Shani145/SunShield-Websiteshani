        <h2>Field Trial Overview: Murray State University</h2>
        <p><strong>Location:</strong> Western Kentucky</p>
        <p><strong>Principal:</strong> Jim Davis, Ph.D.</p>
        <p><strong>Crop:</strong> BMR Sorghum</p>
        <p>The study at Murray State University focused on comparing alternative pasture inoculation methods using Soil Amendment with traditional nitrogen fertilization. The goal was to evaluate grazing performance, Average Daily Gain (ADG), and animal performance on treated pastures.</p>

    <section class="methods">
        <h2>Materials and Methods</h2>
        <p>The trial was conducted on a 12-acre plot, divided into four 3-acre test plots, each treated differently:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Treatment 1 (N):</strong> Nitrogen application (60 units per acre, 3 times during the growing season)</li>
            <li><strong>Treatment 2 (SG):</strong> Soil Amendment at 1 gallon per acre in two split applications</li>
            <li><strong>Treatment 3 (RM):</strong> Raw milk at 2 gallons per acre, applied three times</li>
            <li><strong>Control (C):</strong> No treatment</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Results indicated that the Soil Amendment (SG) and raw milk (RM) treatments significantly improved ADG and AUM compared to nitrogen and control, at lower costs per acre.</p>

        <div class="study">
            <h3>Soil Amendment Fall Gain Test</h3>
            <p>This test examined bull performance on pastures treated with Soil Amendment versus commercial fertilizers. Results showed that Soil Amendment led to increased crude protein and digestibility in forage.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="study">
            <h3>Soil Amendment Rye/Ryegrass/Turnip Trial</h3>
            <p>In a small-scale trial, heifers grazing on Soil Amendment treated pasture gained 1.88 lbs/day, outperforming the 1.75 lbs/day gain in the control. The treated pasture also showed higher protein, phosphorus, and magnesium content.</p>
